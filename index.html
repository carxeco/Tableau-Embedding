<font color="white"> <p>Bad Omens are a Los Angeles metalcore band who traffic in punishing breakdowns and anthemic choruses that evoke contemporaries like Bring Me the Horizon and Periphery. Their first album, 2016's Bad Omens, hit the Billboard rock and independent charts, as did 2019's Finding Go Before God Finds Me. The group's high-contrast, pandemic-inspired third album, The Death of Peace of Mind, followed in 2022.</p>

    <p>The band was born in 2013 from a handful of solo demos by lead singer Noah Sebastian, who eventually added longtime friends Nicholas Ryan (guitar) and Nick Ruffilo (bass) to the fold. A friend of Riquier's, Joakim "Jolly" Karlsson, joined on guitar, and drummer Nick Folio was added after submitting samples over the Internet. Sumerian Records was impressed with the songwriting on the band's early demos and signed them in 2015.</p>
    
    <p>Bad Omens quickly grew a fan base with singles including "Exit Wounds" and "The Worst in Me." Based on an unhealthy relationship of Sebastian's but "universal to all bad habits," their eponymous debut landed on the Billboard rock, hard rock, independent, and Heatseekers album charts upon release in 2016. The group hit all the same charts again with 2019's Finding God Before God Finds Me, which climbed to number seven on the hard rock list. Its singles "Limits" and "Never Know" kept Bad Omens in the Top 30 of the Mainstream Rock Airplay for several months in 2020 and 2021. Following a forced break from touring due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they returned with the triumphant and uncompromising The Death of Peace of Mind in 2022.</p>
